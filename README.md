## Installation
All dependencies are saved in the ````Gemfile````. Run ````bundle install```` (Install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) if it is not already) after cloning the repo.

## Edit Theme
I made everything as easy as possible to edit. Most things can be found in the ````_config.yml````, but if more editing is required digging through the code will be required. The ````head.html```` file is in the ````_includes```` folder and the Sass variables are found in the ````_base.scss```` file in the ````_sass```` folder.

### _config.yml
